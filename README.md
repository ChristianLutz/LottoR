# LottoR
Playing around with R

Note: This is **nonsense** and just for me playing around with R. If you ever think it is possible to calc the next lotto numbers take a statistic course :)

However if you are also just interested in playing around with R you will find some data (here)[1].
Now, all you need todo is replace `pathAndFilename`
